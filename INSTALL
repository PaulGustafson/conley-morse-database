INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS
-----------------------

The conley-morse-database software does not itself requiring
building or installing into system directories. The way it is
to be used is to only compile against user-supplied code
describing dynamical models (see the ./examples/ folder)
and in this case the executables are placed directly into
the model folder.

However, conley-morse-database depends on a number of prerequisite 
packages being installed. We provide an installation script
to acquire and install these packages.

Here is an example installation:
mkdir ~/work && cd ~/work
git clone https://github.com/sharker81/conley-morse-database.git
cd conley-morse-database
./install.sh

You will likely be prompted for a password. If you
do not have a password, see the instructions below
for a nonstandard installation.

This could also create some folders in "work" when it installs
software conley-morse-database depends on.

The installer checks the system to see if it is a Mac or Linux.
If it is a Mac, it uses the Homebrew "brew" installer for its
builds and also installs X11 via XQuartz.
Otherwise it defaults to a standard list of instructions.

Nonstandard Installations
-------------------------
If you do not have administrator rights then you can
choose to install in a non-standard location by typing
./install.sh [non-standard-install-dir]

(Warning: This option will be ignored on Mac OS X.
If you, really, really want to do this, you could type
./bin/install-linux.sh [non-standard-install-dir]
and it will pretend you have a Linux system.)

This is likely the case on an HPC cluster that is administered
by others. Here is an example of an installation in that case::

mkdir ~/work && cd ~/work
git clone https://github.com/sharker81/conley-morse-database.git
cd conley-morse-database
./install.sh ~/work

Again, this will also create other directories for other
installation that are required apart from conley-morse-database.
These will be placed in the ~/work folder.
